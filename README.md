# Money Manager

An app that offers a simple UI with a sqflite database to keep track of your monthly income and expenses.

## Getting Started

- Clone this Repo
- Open Android Studio and choose this as a exisitng project
- Adapt files to create proper classes for your needs (expense_incons.dart and income_icons.dart)
- Adapt file to set your names (change enum in the adding_screen.dart file)
- Flash your emulator 

This App only performs the basic tasks of a money manager on a local machine (German only). However, i also created a more sophisticated version that can be connected over firebase to synchronize over multiple devices as well as additional statistics. If you are interested in this solution, don't hesitate to contact me.
